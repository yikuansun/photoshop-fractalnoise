# Fractal Noise Plugin for Photoshop

Fractal Noise is a powerful tool for creating visual effects in softwares such as After Effects and Blender. But Photoshop's Clouds filter pales in comparison to the more advanced noise tools in these other softwares. Clouds offers almost no customization, making it virtually useless for actual artwork. This plugin aims to fill that gap by offering a more customizable fractal noise generator.

## Features

- Customizable size, frequency, and octaves
- Seed for reproducibility
- Seamless, tileable output
- Natural color variance (with options to invert and desaturate)

## Installation

> [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/yikuansun/photoshop-fractalnoise/releases/download/v1.0.0/996ca066_PS.ccx) (open the CCX file to install)
